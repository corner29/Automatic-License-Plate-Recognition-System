# Automatic Number Plate Recognition

This is our solution repo hosting the code and approach used for Mosaic'21.
<br>
> With the ever-increasing need for transportation globally, the amount of vehicles on the road is piling everyday. The need for automatic traffic monitoring has never been so high. Your task is to implement an automatic number plate recognizer in an **unconstrained condition** that considers occlusion, poor quality of images, and **other spatial variations** in image data.
